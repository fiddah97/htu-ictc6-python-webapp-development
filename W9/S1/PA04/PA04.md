For this practical assignment you will be building a ToDo list web application using Flask. This MVP (minimum viable product) is just a proof of concept for the next project you will be building for PA05. This project will help you solidify and test your knowledge in the Flask basics, session concepts and basic knowledge of Bootstrap. 

## General Notes

    * Think about your data model. Use a paper and a pencil to design the data model.
    * Think about your design, make sure it works well, and then looks good :).
    * Document your code well, please write descriptive comments.
    * No persistance is required for this project, if you wish to add persistance read the extra credit section below.

## Project Design

Our simple Todo List application, we have a single user, this user has a dictionary of todo lists. Each todo list has a list of todo tasks.

Below is a sample representation of a data model. Make sure you include at least the fields found in the sample below.

### Data Model

```python

import json
from status import Status       # Remember to import status and priority from the provided files
from priority import Priority

# task lists

tasklists = {
    1: {"id": 123,
        "name": "Python list",
        "last_updated": "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z",
        "created_at": "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z",
        "tasks": [
